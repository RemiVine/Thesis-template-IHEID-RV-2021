# Thesis-template-IHEID
This is a LaTeX template for paper-based IHEID thesis

The template allows to have a thesis with independent chapters, containing their own appendices and bibliographies. On the other hand, it is meant to have sections, figures, etc. numbered as part of a consistent document. 

The use of this template shall be rather intuitive. The folder "Chapter" is meant to include the main.tex document, one by one, of your thesis. The respective bibliographies are to be inserted in the "Bibliography" folder.


The folder contains:
 
 
 Bibliographies
  preable.bib
  paper1.bib
  ...
 Chapters
  0_Abstract_Page.tex
  0_Acknowledgments.tex
  0_pre_thesis_quote_dedication_etc.tex
